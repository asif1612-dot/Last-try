# Task 4 — Geometrical & Fuzzy Probability

## Inputs
- NDVI: ndvi_s2_2024_growing_season.tif

## Parameters
- Grid ~ 250 m cells (computed from raster resolution)
- Crisp threshold t = 0.50
- Fuzzy μ_veg: 0 at 0.20, 1 at 0.70 (linear in-between)

## Findings — Geometrical Probability
- Mean cell P(NDVI ≥ t): ____
- Spatial pattern: (where are highest/lowest cells?)
- Sensitivity to t (if tested): ____

## Findings — Fuzzy Membership
- Mean μ_veg: ____
- Areas with gradual transitions: ____
- What μ captured that crisp missed: ____

## Contrast: Crisp vs Fuzzy
- When crisp is preferable: (e.g., hard decisions, masks)
- When fuzzy helps: (gradual transitions, mixed land cover)
- Recommendation for this ROI: ____

## Next steps
- Try different cell sizes (e.g., 150 m / 500 m).
- Adjust fuzzy breakpoints (a,b) based on phenology/land cover.

Contrast crisp vs fuzzy for this ROI:

Where did crisp P(NDVI ≥ t) give confident “vegetated vs not” decisions?
Where did μ_veg expose gradual transitions or mixed pixels?
When is fuzziness helpful?
Discuss ecotones, mixed land cover, sensor noise, edges, or seasonal transitions.

Parameter sensitivity:
How would results change if t = 0.4 or 0.6? If (A,B) = (0.15, 0.65) vs (0.25, 0.75)?

Actionable note:
For mapping/monitoring in this ROI, would you recommend crisp masks, fuzzy scores, or both
(e.g., fuzzy for analysis, crisp for deployment)?
